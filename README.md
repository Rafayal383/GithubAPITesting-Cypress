Project: GitHub API Automation
Project Description:
This project automates the testing of GitHub APIs to validate key repository management operations such as creation, modification, deletion, and file handling. The automation framework is built using Cypress for API testing, ensuring efficient validation of RESTful endpoints with structured assertions and reporting.

Tech Stack Used:
✅ API Automation: Cypress (API Testing)
✅ Programming Language: JavaScript
✅ Test Reporting: Allure Reports

Scope of Automation:

Repository Management:
Creating a new repository
Updating repository details (name, description, visibility)
Deleting a repository
File Operations:
Adding files to a repository
Modifying existing files
Committing changes
Validation Checks:
HTTP response status and headers validation
Response body structure and schema verification
Authentication and authorization handling
Key Benefits:

Fast and efficient API test execution with Cypress
Comprehensive test reports using Allure for insights and debugging
Scalable and maintainable test scripts for CI/CD integration
